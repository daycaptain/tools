Tooling for DayCaptain


== Command line tools

https://github.com/daycaptain/tools/blob/main/todos-add[todos-add]: A shell script that adds a todo to the user's inbox. Requires `curl` and `jq` (for encoding the JSON string).

It makes sense to create a shell alias for the command line scripts, to conveniently access them, + 
e.g. `alias tda='todos-add'`
