Tooling for DayCaptain


== Command line tools

_There are two different command line tool technologies available, to support as many systems as possible: a Bash script and a https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang^] version._

https://github.com/daycaptain/tools/blob/main/todos-add[todos-add]: A shell script that adds a todo to the user's inbox or a specific day or week.

It makes sense to create a shell alias for the command line scripts, to conveniently access them, + 
e.g. `alias tda='todos-add'`

Have a look at both versions in the `jbang/` and `bash/` folder.
The Bash version requires `curl`, `jq`, and `getopt`, the JBang version requires only a JBang installation.
