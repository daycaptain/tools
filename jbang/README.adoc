= Running tools with JBang

In order to execute these tools, you need a https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang^] installation on your system.
All other dependencies will be downloaded for you.

The scripts include a command line directive (`/usr/bin/env jbang`) to be executed directly:

----
./todos-add "My task"
----

== Native compilation

You can optionally build a native executable, with the native image support:

----
jbang --native todos-add
----
